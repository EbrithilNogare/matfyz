\section*{THIRD}
Most of the time, I'm introvert person, especially in presence of foreign people (those I don't know).
As a rule, I'm most of the time in front of computer. 
Suddenly, I become paper less person, which mean I'm not using paper on thing that can be in electronic form.
On the whole, I like doing crazy things outdoor with friends, but on the other side I also enjoy being alone.
Generally, I'm more sports active as I'm getting older.
