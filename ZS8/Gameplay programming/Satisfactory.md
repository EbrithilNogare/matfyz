## Gameplay Video

The video starts with a view of an open world with some prepared foundations to build on.  
The first building is a miner, which, when placed on an ore source, will produce raw caterium ore.  
To process this ore, a factory is built. Usually, the factory is constructed from individual factories and conveyor belts.  
To speed things up, the player can prepare entire factory blocks called blueprints.  
Four blueprints are placed and connected to neighboring structures, the miner, and electricity.  
The ore is smelted into ingots and cut into wires, which are then delivered to a deposit.  
Towards the end, it becomes clear that something is wrong, as items won't enter the deposit.  
The player must check what is not working and fix it.  
In this case, the deposit is not connected to electricity.

## 1.) Satisfaction

The entire game revolves around delivering more and more advanced materials and products to fulfill company goals.  
Satisfaction comes from delivering these items and completing tasks.

## 2.) Learning

Recipes for products and more advanced factories are unlocked gradually, so the player learns new technology piece by piece.

## 3.) Efficiency

The factory must grow!  
It feels addictive to constantly improve your factory.

## 4.) Immersion

Unlike Factorio or Shapez, this game is built with Unreal Engine, using it to immerse the player with realistic models, textures, and atmosphere.  
Players can not only build a factory but also explore the world with enemies, secrets, and stunning views.

## 5.) Motivation

The game is as challenging as you make it. If you want a small factory, it’s easy to build, but you will wait years to deliver the required quantities.  
On the other hand, you can go all out and, with enough motivation, build a super-optimized factory down to the last item per second.

## 6.) Emotion

There is an enormous sense of satisfaction in completing a working factory (or hopelessness if something doesn’t work as expected).  
Players can also die and lose items or forget items after traveling across the entire map, which can be frustrating.

## 7.) Socialization

This game supports multiplayer, and when I played with a friend, our factory grew even faster.  
There is also an amazing community that provides blueprints and tools to build an optimized factory.
