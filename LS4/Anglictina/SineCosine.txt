respectively = individually = take one by one
differentiable = its derivation exists
in terms of = in the meaning of
assume = having some fulfilled reuirements
circumference = length of the line of the circle 
arbitrary = we can choose anything from set
denote = to show
set = give value to variable
ordered pair = tuple of two numbers which are in specific order
briefly = not so complicated
hence = something is as it is because of something else
sufficiently = good enought
from which it follows = therefore because of it
