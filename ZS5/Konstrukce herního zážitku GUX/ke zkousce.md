Lecture 2
1) Concerning the method of your research, you should be aware of this structure when you design your study focused on games:
- The aim of the study?
- Why is this topic interesting?
- Theoretical Framework
- What do we know so far about the topic?
- Research design + intervention
- Research sample
- Hypotheses
- Findings
- Implications + Future + Limitations
2) Concerning attitudes, you should be aware of the following
- What are attitudes and their functions?
- Explicit vs Implicit attitudes
3)      Why study attitudes in relation to video games?
The case study was based on the article in the attachment (it should be able to answer the questions related to attitudes in the first parts, you definitely do not have to be aware of things beyond that)
4) Check the video:

You should be aware of the main concepts mentioned there

(I do not need you to know all the methods by heart, but you should read the chapter and be aware when is something more useful to use than something else etc.)

Expect the rest (Lecture 11 + 12) during the weekend, I have to rerecord 11 as the sound quality is lets say not ideal.


LECTURE 11
I have tried to improve all the parts with problematic sounds, not sure what was happening that week, but I had to redone all my lectures from it – In case that some parts are still problematic, let me know – I will create a commentary.
Lecture 11 – Emotions
https://youtu.be/W8GsJamXUT4
Here is the summary:
•       What are emotions and their functions
•       Misattribution of the physiological arousal
•       Emotional arousal extended to the whole situation
•       What is unique about games and some implications for games from the above mentioned
•       Game feel and novelty in games
•       PANAS
 

LECTURE 12
Below is the lecture about effects of videogames part 2. In general, if it is not emphasized enough in the video, we have some data about positive effects of some particular games on some conditions (ADHD, depression etc.), but the question related to general effects of games on mental/physical health etc. are a little bit more complicated to answer as there might be many moderators, it is hard to tell the direction of causality and our data are currently limited.
