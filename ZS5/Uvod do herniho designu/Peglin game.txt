Peglin game
Game was choosen from steam library as a game which has early access (free demo from unfinished game).
So I didn't have to pay, but get quality game with only first map (I dont need more to test it).

I download game and play two rounds that is around 2 hours and so I succesfully finished the demo.
My partner played clean game (without my proggress) after for 3 hours and played 4 rounds.

Game has no tutorial, player is just put into the first level and is all alone to get know how.


Jelikož hra nemá tutoriál, hráč na vše musí přijít sám, naštěstí se to dá hrát bez strategie a jelikož je intuitivní, tak hráč brzy začne vymýšlet lepší strategii, kam střílet orb.
