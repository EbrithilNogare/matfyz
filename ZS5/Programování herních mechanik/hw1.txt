Far cry 4

Satisfaction:
Being better than AI soldiers and killing them as some super human.
Completing quests and collecting new stuff as guns or upgrading house.

Learning:
At the beginning is tutorial, so first 15 minutes you learn a lot.
Gradually player needs more space for loot or money, so he need to learn crafting and hunting.
And the most time consuming part is mastering skill to shoot, to learn headshots or how is AI behave.

Efficiency:
Player gets constant stream of quests, which are interlacing with karma missions, collectiong collectables or crafting items. 
If player is bored of repeated action, he can always choose different missions or challenges, which give him more advantege in future.

Immersion
The game has very good and realistic graphic, making gameplay experience much stronger.
Also skill tree and upgradable weapons make it little RPG game, which makes player more immersed into game.

Motivation:
The game has three difficulties, so everybody can choose how he likes it.
Enemies are not that hard at the beginning, as your weapons are weak, but more area you unlock stronger enemies and stronger weapons will show up.
For beginner is the game little bit hard, which is improving by time as they learn how to shoot, improve strategy etc.
It is skill game, so playing it again from beggining will make gameplay easier unless you play it on harder difficulty.

Emotion:
Whole game is accompanied with satisfaction of beating enemies.
After story quests there are also emotions from story, primarly at the end of the main quest line. 

Socialization:
Yes, I watched many streamers and get their look at game and improve some strategies from them.
Also story isnt as clean as it is get from gameplay so some explanation from others is helpfull.
