# Content

The repository contains a `task` directory for each lab week.
Inside that directory, further directories contain one or
more assignments, described in `ASSIGNMENT.md` files.
The `task` directories are added gradually,
pull before each lab.

# Submissions

Please commit your solution to each assignment into the directory with the corresponding `ASSIGNMENT.md` file.
As a rule, always write a brief report about what you did in a `SOLUTION.md` file on in the solution notebook.
Do include a compiled version of the notebook as `SOLUTION.html`, also include build scripts and instructions.
Do not commit binaries or temporary build artifacts.

Tag your solution with `done-01` to `done-05` as appropriate.
Do not forget to push your solution, including the tag,
remember that tags must be handled explicitly.

# Grading

Each solution is awarded points on a scale of 0 to 10 per lab week,
with 10 intended for solutions that solve the assignments reasonably well,
bonus points will be awarded for doing something special so going above 10 is possible.

The solutions are graded primarily on the day before the next class,
which this year means every second Tuesday. The grading result
will be in a file called `GRADING.md` in the corresponding
`task` directory.

# Late

Solutions not submitted on time will not be graded during the semester.
Before the exam period, students can ask for late grading of such
solutions, and for repeated grading of updated solutions, which
will be done at the start of the exam period. There is
no point penalty for this late grading, and there are
no other opportunities for grading.

To submit your solution for late grading, tag it with `late-01` to `late-05` as appropriate.
Do not forget to push your solution, including the tag, before the start of the exam period.
